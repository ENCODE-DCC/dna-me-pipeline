# Your job's input variables (if any) will be loaded as environment

# Any code outside of main() (or any entry point you may add) is

    # To report any recognized errors in the correct format in
    # $HOME/job_error.json and exit this script, you can use the
    # dx-jobutil-report-error utility as follows:
    #
    #   dx-jobutil-report-error "My error message"
    #
    # Note however that this entire bash script is executed with -e
    # when running in the cloud, so any line which returns a nonzero
    # exit code will prematurely exit the script; if no error was
    # reported in the job_error.json file, then the failure reason
    # will be AppInternalError with a generic error message.

    # The following line(s) use the dx command-line tool to upload your file
    # outputs after you have created them on the local file system.  It assumes
    # that you have used the output field name for the filename for each output,
    # but you can change that behavior to suit your needs.  Run "dx upload -h"
    # to see more options to set metadata.

    echo `ls /home/dnanexus/output`
    mv output/$read_fn1.gz_bismark_pe.sam output/$read_fn1.fq_bismark.sam

    # class.  Run "dx-jobutil-add-output -h" for more information on what it
    # does.
